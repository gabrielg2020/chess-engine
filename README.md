# Chess Engine
This repo holds chess engines made in different languages made by me!

## How does it work?
A React+JS frontend that also runs the game of chess. Frontend sends the game state data where the different backends's listen. Backend sends instruction back to the frontend to update.

## Why not code the chess game?
1. I have done it before, and it would be boring for me.
2. I just want to be able to measure how fast & accurate each language's implementation is at finding the best move.

## Languages Implemented
- Go

## Run Locally
### Frontend
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`
### Go Backend
1. `cd api/go`
2. `go run main.go`
